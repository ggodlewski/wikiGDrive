## Code

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](test.md).



### Typescript / Javascript

  export interface MyInterface extends Other {

    myProperty: any;

  }

}

declare magicNumber number;

myArray.forEach(() => { }); // fat arrow syntax

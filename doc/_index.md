WikiGDrive is a node app that uses the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs) to transform Google Docs and Drawings into markdown.

With a "Shared Drive" as the key, WikiGDrive:

* Reads all the files from a Google "Shared Drive"
* Builds a map of the driveId (URL) to the pathname in the "Shared Drive"
* For each Google Document:
    * Converts to a Markdown file with the path (instead of the driveId for the file)
    * Changes driveId to the path (eg: 12lvdxKgGsD.../edit would be changed to /filename
    * Support diagrams as SVG (and map the URLs in the diagram)

WikiGDrive scans for changes in the drive and then refresh the local converted files.

![Publish wikigdrive to NPM](https://github.com/mieweb/wikiGDrive/workflows/Publish%20wikigdrive%20to%20NPM/badge.svg)

```
npm i -g @mieweb/wikigdrive
```

## App setup

1. Go to [console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Create New Project
3. Enable Apis -> add Google Drive API
4. Enable Apis -> Add Google Docs API
5. Credentials -> Create Credentials (OAuth Client ID) -> Other ( see authorization section )

## Usage and options

Init workdir with (creates internal .wgd directory):

```
wikigdrive init --drive "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID"

--service_account=wikigdrive.json
--config /location/of/.wgd - Location of config file
--dest /location/of/downloaded/content - Destination for downloaded and converted markdown files

--client_id - ID of google app, alternatively can be passed in .env or through environment variable CLIENT_ID;
--client_secret - Secret of google app, alternatively can be passed in .env or through environment variable CLIENT_SECRET;

--link_mode - Style of internal markdown links
--link_mode mdURLs - `/filename.md`
--link_mode dirURLs - `/filename/`
--link_mode uglyURLs - `/filename.html` - see https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/
```

List available drive ids that wikigdrive has access to on Google:

```
wikigdrive drives
```

Run one time documents pull

```
wikigdrive pull
```

Run server mode

```
wikigdrive server
```

## Example usage with Hugo Generator

1. Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

2. Create a New Site

```
hugo new site quickstart
```

3. Add a Theme

```
cd quickstart
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
```

4. Install wikigdrive

```
npm i -g @mieweb/wikigdrive
```

5. Sync GDrive

```
wikigdrive init --drive "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID" --dest ./content --link_mode uglyURLs
wikigdrive pull
```

Note that by default you need to use [uglyURLs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#ugly-urls) with Hugo.

6. Generate HTML

```
hugo
```

or start server for development:

```
hugo server
```

## Example usage with Hexo Generator

1. Install [hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/main.html)

```
npm i -g hexo-cli
```

2. Create a New Site

```
hexo init quickstart
```

3. Add a Theme

By default, hexo installs `landscape` theme. If you need another one check [hexo themes](https://hexo.io/docs/themes)

4. Install wikigdrive

```
npm i -g @mieweb/wikigdrive
```

5. Sync GDrive

```
wikigdrive init --drive "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID" --dest ./source --link_mode uglyURLs
wikigdrive pull
```

6. Generate HTML

```
hexo generate
```

or start server for development:

```
hexo serve
```

## Authorization

There are two methods: individual credentials or a service account.

* [Individual](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/end-user#creating_your_client_credentials)
* [Service Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority)

Note: If the authentication is successful, but the account does not have access to documents in gdrive, there is currently no way to know if the directory is empty or just not possible to see.

## FAQ

### What is the purpose of this tool?

To enable collaborative editing of documentation and the ability to publish that documentation as well as linking it to revision control system branches (like in git)

### Why use Google at all. Why not use markdown and GitHub?

No collaboration in real-time. Also, markdown requires skill when managing screenshots and diagrams that are not easily accomplished in markdown.

### Why not just use Google Docs?

Would love it if it were possible, but drive does not offer the ability to publish pages cleanly. The URLs are not SEO friendly. Would love it if there was a driveId map where every document could be given a friendly name (aka its title on the drive). Then (like Wikipedia has disambiguation pages), a reader could be redirected to the proper content. Google doesnâ€™t, so this project is an attempt to fill that gap.

Also, Google does not have a good blame system for contributions to a document. Hopefully this is fixed someday but in the meantime, GitHub on markdown can _help_ fill the void.

### Why markdown?

All ears for a different preferred format. It's easy to read when editing directly and when doing a diff for changes is clean

### What about mismatches in Docs vs Markdown

There are features of Google Docs that are not going to be supported. Like coloring text, page breaks, headers, comments, etc. These features are not core to our goals for clean WYSIYYM.

Keeping a WYSIWYM style ensures a good mobile experience to view and edit.

### Why not make a website front end to a Google shared drive?

Our goals are to be able to take versions of the content and commit them along with a version of the code at a point in time. By just making a website, it would allow for real-time viewing of the content but no way to go to a specific version of the documentation at a given time.

A website front end is a goal for real-time testing of the viewing experience, but initially, we want to make markdown that can be committed.
